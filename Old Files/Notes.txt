notes for udc:
    doctors:
        -> recurring date (bool flags in db -> r/!r)
        -> allow sched modification
        -> day and week in calendar form view 
            (i.e. weekly view?) (mukhang animo sys lol)
        -> day and week in agenda view
            (prolly vbox[7] with labels)
        -> real time (timer task -> controller sends update flags)
        -> no overlaps (dc2) and see free and reserved (dc2)

    secretary:
        -> access to doctors view
        -> set schedule
        -> notifs when almost event?
        -> get free times of doctors
        -> set color for schedule
        -> realtime (timer task again)
    
    client:
        -> access to doctors view
        -> set appointment
        -> cancel own appointments
        -> see reservations 
            (select * from appointments where id = client_id?)
